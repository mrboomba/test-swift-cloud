3. **Start the Application**

    Use Docker Compose to start the project:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up
    ```

    This command will build and start the necessary containers.

4. **Access the Application Locally**

    - **Awesome Frontend**: Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to access the Awesome Frontend.

    - **GraphQL Playground**: To interact with the GraphQL API, visit [http://localhost:4000/playground](http://localhost:4000/playground).

## API Documentation

### `getSongs` Query

#### Description

Retrieves a list of songs based on specified filtering and sorting criteria.

#### Arguments

- `orderBy` (type: `SongOrderByInput`): Specifies the sorting order for the results. You can choose to sort by fields like `Year`, `PlaysJune`, `PlaysJuly`, or `PlaysAugust` in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

- `skip` (type: `Int`): Allows you to skip a specified number of songs in the result set. Useful for pagination.

- `take` (type: `Int`): Limits the number of songs returned in the result set. Use this for pagination or limiting query size.

- `where` (type: `SongWhereInput`): Provides criteria for filtering the songs. You can filter by fields such as `Song`, `Album`, or `Year`. The filter conditions are combined using the `AND` logical operator.

#### Example Usage

```graphql
query {
  getSongs(
    orderBy: { Year: ASC, PlaysJune: DESC }
    skip: 0
    take: 10
    where: { Year: 2000, Album: "Greatest Hits" }
  ) {
    Song
    Artist
    Year
  }
}
```

This query retrieves the top 10 songs from the year 2000 with the "Greatest Hits" album, sorted in ascending order by year and descending order by June play counts.

### Response

The response will be a list of songs, with each song containing the following fields:

-   `Song` (String): The name of the song.
-   `Artist` (String): The artist or performer of the song.
-   `Year` (Int): The year the song was released.

## Additional Notes

-   The GraphQL Playground is accessible at [http://localhost:4000/playground](http://localhost:4000/playground) for interactive exploration and testing of GraphQL queries.
    
-   Remember to handle errors gracefully when using this API, as indicated by the `try-catch` block in the resolver for error handling.
    

Feel free to adapt and expand this API documentation to provide more details as needed for your project.
